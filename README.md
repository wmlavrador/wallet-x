> The Wallet-x system is a small project aimed at training in #DDD, #TDD, #Clean Code, #Clean Architecture, #Docker, 'Queue' with #Redis, and more.

> The idea is to provide a simple transfer of funds between user wallets. Users can transfer funds between Wallets by type, for example, from Wallet type Crypto to Wallet type Crypto, based on certain rules and checks with external services.

### Adjustments and improvements

The project is still under development and the next updates will focus on the following tasks:

- [ ] Define the type of wallet to make transfers
- [ ] Implement notifications on SMS/Whatsapp/Email channels when completing the transaction
- [ ] Routes to obtain transaction details for a given wallet
- [ ] Authenticate routes and authorize transfer by only user authenticated
